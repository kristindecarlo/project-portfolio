<h3>Video Title-  “Don’t Fear the Internet”<h3>
<h4>Speaker- Russ Machmeyer<h4>
<h5>Link- <a href="http://vimeo.com/24006296"> Video 1</a>  <a href="http://vimeo.com/27833342"> Video 2</a>   <a href="http://vimeo.com/25665411"> Video 3</a> </h5>
<p>I thought that these three videos went together really well and gave me a lot of information.  I liked how there were graphics that went along with what the speaker was saying.  I felt like they went really well together, for instance when the guy was talking about what it would be like to use inline style there were illustrations showing what it was like to change over 300 paragraphs.  I learned a lot about the different kinds of websites, there are static websites and dynamic websites.  I also learned that the senator who is in charge of the internet for all of America thought that the internet was made with tubes.  But, really that isn’t true, it is connected by wires and servers.</p>
<ol>
    Three things I learned:
<li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
<li>There are different ways to apply style to html, one is inline styling, this is when you change each individual element, another is internal styling, this is when you put all of your style in the head, and the last is external css which is what we do with a separate style sheet.</li>
<li>When you are testing websites you should test them on all of the popular browsers, like Safari, Chrome, ect. Because even though they are widley the same, they do have differences and its important to see that they work on everything.</li>

<h3>2013/14 Brand Frost</h3>
<h4>Speaker- Brad Frost</h4>
<h5>Link- <a href="http://vimeo.com/63437853"> 2013/14 Brand Frost</a> </h5> 
<p>This was my favorite of the videos we watched.  I thought that Brad was a really good speaker and his use of images and graphs really helped me learn.  He also was pulling together such interesting information that I would have never thought was true.  It was crazy to hear that last year 10% of the photos ever taken since the first photograph was taken, were taken.  It seems like a huge amount for just one year.  I really got the sense of what an information overload was by the way he showed how many ads come up, and talked about how a professional write must feel when every 14 year old girl has a blog, or what a music maker might think when a person can download a cheap music thing and make music that sounds better than theirs.  He really put a lot into perspective for me and I really learned a lot about the current state of the world.</p>
<ol>
    Three things I learned-
<li>380 billion photos were taken last year, that is 10% of all photos ever taken.</li>
<li>The phrase “information overload” was made in 1970, but the information overload back then cannot even compare  to what we are in now</li>
<li>It is important to do what we love and to continue to do great things, even though humans are the things that make all the noise and information overload, we also do change things for the good and can use technology and information to help people.</li>

<h3>10 Thinkgs I didn’t Know About HTML</h3>
<h4>Speaker- Mathas Byers</h4>
<h5>Link- <a href="http://vimeo.com/89935203"> 10 Things I didn't Know about HTML</a> </h5>
<p>This was my least favorite of the videos we watched.  I thought that Mathas was very monotone and uninteresting.  It seemed like he wasn’t very interested in what he was talking about.  I did like his use of gifs and pictures though, I just wished that that funnieness and entertainment carried into his presentation more.  Some of the things he talked about also seemed to go over myhead.  I wasn’t really sure what was going on when he was talking about Javascript and some of the really close details he was talking about.  But, his tips on CSS and HTML all were interesting and seem like they would make coding easier and shorter.  I did not know that for Javascript the charecters used do not seem like they are English.  It was funny how he gave 5 examples and asked which one was not valid, they were all crazy charecters except for one was English, and the English one was the one that was not valid.</p>
    <ol>
Three things I learned:
<li>Validation isn’t everything.  Sometimes the validator doesn’t catch everything you do wrong, but it is good for cathing mistakes like a wrong element.</li>
<li>You can omit the head tags and the body tags because they are implied tags.</li>
<li>A lot of people think that semi colons are optional, but a lot of times they are not and if you aren’t sure if one is needed or not you should put it in just in case.</li>
